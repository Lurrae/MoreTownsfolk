					FarFromHome: Do I gotta walk all the way back home from here? Fiiine, but I can't guarantee I won't leave tons of animal corpses in my wake.
					LoveSpace: Being able to work alone is nice. When your job is as dirty as mine, it helps to not have people to complain.
					DislikeCrowded: Being around so many people is rough. Hard to work when you have a bunch of people complaining about how it smells, you know?
					HateCrowded: If one more person complains about blood on their property, their pancreas is mine. This crowd is unbearable!
					LoveBiome: I love {BiomeName}? What? I shouldn't be saying this. As in, like, this text shouldn't appear in the game. At all.
					LikeBiome: What's there to like about The Crimson? Maybe I'm a fan of the macabre... or insane! Hey, I won't rule the possibility out.
					DislikeBiome: The desert is so laaame. Everything's either dead or a cactus.
					HateBiome: The Hallow makes me want to vomit. The only redeeming quality of it is that the unicorns have colorful entrails.

					LoveSpace: I like not being so close to people. It allows me to have plenty of secrecy.
					DislikeCrowded: Ooh, a few too many people to moderate me... not a good way to live.
					HateCrowded: So many people... I can't do anything around here without someone turning their nose up at me...
					LoveBiome: I love {BiomeName}... But you weren't supposed to know that, since this text shouldn't appear ingame...
					LikeBiome: The Corruption... It helps me get all my cruel thoughts flowing... I feel right at home...
					DislikeBiome: The Jungle... So resistant to corruption... and for what? Mud and turtles...
					HateBiome: The Hallow is repulsive. So saccharine and sweet, and yet harbors cruel pixies and light fiends... At least I do not lie about my evil...
					LoveNPC: "{NPCName} is exciting with a tad of bloodthirst... I'd let her take my heart..."
					LikeNPC: "{NPCName} is a sinful soul... and a good neighbor."
					LikeNPC_Princess: "{NPCName} is such an incorruptible youth... I can't bring myself to steer her to evil..."
